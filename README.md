# Code Explanation

The provided HTML code is a basic structure of a webpage with a loading screen.

- `<!DOCTYPE html>`: This declaration helps with the browser's interpretation of the HTML content. It's not an HTML tag; it's an instruction to the web browser about what version of HTML the page is written in.

- `<html lang="en">`: This is the root element of an HTML page. The `lang` attribute declares the language of this web page to be English.

- `<head>`: This tag contains meta-information about the HTML document that isn't displayed on the page. It typically includes the title of the document, character encoding, styles, scripts, and other meta information.

- `<meta charset="UTF-8" />`: This defines the character encoding for the page to be UTF-8, which includes most characters from the vast majority of written languages.

- `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />`: This makes the webpage responsive on different devices. It sets the width of the page to follow the screen-width of the device and the initial zoom level when first loading the page.

- `<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css" />`: This links the external CSS file (`style.css`) to the HTML document.

- `<title>Loading Screen</title>`: This sets the title of the webpage, which appears in the browser tab.

- `<body>`: This contains the content of the webpage that will be visible to the user.

- `<section class="loading">`: This is a container for the loading screen content. The `class` attribute is used to apply CSS styles.

- `For new sidebar colors, Click your workspace name, then Preferences > Sidebar > Theme`: This is the text displayed on the loading screen.

- `<span class="loading__author"> - Your friends at Slack</span>`: This is a span element that contains a message from the authors. The `class` attribute is used to apply CSS styles.

- `<span class="loading__anim"></span>`: This is an empty span element with a class `loading__anim`. It's likely used to display some sort of loading animation via CSS.

# CSS Explanation

The provided CSS code is a `@keyframes` rule that defines an animation named `rotate`.

- `@keyframes rotate`: This is a keyframes rule that defines an animation named 'rotate'.

- `to`: The 'to' keyword represents the end state of the animation.

- `transform: rotate(1turn);`: In this case, at the end of the animation, the element will be transformed by rotating 1 full turn (or 360 degrees). This animation can be used in conjunction with the 'animation' property on a CSS selector.

Here's an example of how to use this animation:

```css
div {
  animation: rotate 2s linear infinite;
}
```
